Analysis:
The second approach, where each section was broken down into different prompts, was the quickest and most efficient. This approach allowed for a more organized and focused writing process, as each prompt addressed a specific section of the essay. It also provided clear instructions for each section, making it easier for the writer to follow and complete the essay.

On the other hand, the first approach of providing a single prompt for the entire essay was at a disadvantage as it required the writer to come up with the structure and organization of the essay on their own. This approach could lead to a less cohesive and coherent essay, as the writer may struggle to maintain a logical flow and address all the necessary points.

In terms of getting the best results, the second approach of breaking down each section into different prompts would be more effective. This approach ensures that each section of the essay is given proper attention and allows for a more thorough and comprehensive analysis of Michael Jordan's basketball career. It also provides a clear structure for the writer to follow, resulting in a well-organized and cohesive essay.
